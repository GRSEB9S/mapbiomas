        <p>All MAPBIOMAS Project products available are beta version (proof of concept) and are only intended to test the feasibility and efficiency of both the production methodology of annual land cover/land use maps, as well as the the performance and operational capability of the Web Platform designed to enable collaborative work.</p>
        <p>The beta version products are still incomplete and have not yet been validated. Therefore, many spatial inconsistencies in the thematic classifications(between classes and between years) are likely to be encountered.</p>
        <p>The maps will be made as collections as they are validated and corrected, according to the stages of product development. The Collection 1 are currently in preparation and will be launched, as a validated product, in the first semester of 2016, comprising data from 2008 to 2015.</p>
