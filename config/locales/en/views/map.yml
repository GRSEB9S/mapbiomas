          <p>TThe MapBiomas Collection 3 includes annual land use and land cover data for the period of 1985 to 2017.</p>
          <p>This collection results from the first 3 years of the project and it is under constant development.</p>
          <p>The maps may present a series of imperfections such as possible spatial and temporal mapping inconsistencies that may affect the biomes and cross-cutting theme classes.</p>
          <p>In case of doubt, critics and ideas to improve the data please contact: <a href="mailto:contato@mapbiomas.org">contato@mapbiomas.org</a>.</p>

        body: |
          <p>Here pixel by pixel classification changes are demonstrated for the maps os the followed period: (a) All the years 1985 - 2017; (b) Forest Code 2008 à 2017; (c) Forest Code Approval 2012-2017; (d) GEE National Inventory (1994-2002; 2000-2010; 2010-2017); (e) Any consecutive years (e.g. 1985-1986); (f) 5 year period 1985-1990 / 1990-1995 / 1995-2000...
          <p>Select the desired period and visualize the changes in the map and in the Sankey diagram. Click in the different diagram transitions to see the different class transitions of the map.</p>
          <p class="warning"><strong>ATTENTION:</strong>
          <blockquote>
            <p>In MapBiomas Collection 3 the class transitions may represent effective land use changes as well as classification inconsistencies. Therefore, such changes may not be a reliable representation of this land use changes in the period.</p>
            <p>The sum of each class total areas within in the transition table may present small differences when compared with the land cover data for the same period, this may be associated to the filter applied on the transition map</p>

        title: Mosaic Quality
        body: |
          <p>A mosaic is a composition of pixels from several Landsat scenes among a specific period. Each scene may have a proportion of clouds and others interferences. Thus, each pixel in a given year was classified according to the quantity of available observations, which may vary from 0 to 23 observations per year.</p>

              <li>By default the page opens with the Map of Brazil. To <b>choose another territory</b> use the first frame on the left side. Choose the type of territory (State / City / Biome) and enter in the box the name of the desired territory.</li>
              <li>To <b>view different classes in the legend</b> deselect all classes and then click in the desired classes. Note that the legend is hierarchical. The top level is always below the levels of greater detail. Example: Mangrove stands above Forest Formations that sits above Forest. To view level 1 (more aggregate) of the legend select only classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</li>
              <li>To change <b>image background</b> layers select [IMAGES] in the left caption box.</li>

              <li>By default the page opens in the territory that is selected in the COVERAGE screen. To <b>choose another territory</b> use the first frame on the left side. Choose the type of territory (State / City / Biome) and enter in the box the name of the desired territory.</li>
              <li>The legend is simplified and groups the transitions into <b>five classes</b>: [red] all transitions from natural vegetation to anthropic areas; [green] all transitions from farming and non-vegetation areas to natural vegetation cover; [blue] all transitions to water; [purple] transitions to planted forests; [gray] other transitions or no transition.</li>
              <li>To change <b>image background</b> layers select [IMAGES] in the left caption box. When selecting the [LANDSAT MOSAIC] background image the screen will have a split in half. On the left side will appear the image of the start year of the transition and the right side will show the image of final year. When scrolling the vertical bar left and right you can see the transition in the Landsat images used by MapBiomas. For better viewing use the transparency bar in the upper left corner.</li>
